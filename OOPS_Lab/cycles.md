# LIST OF EXPERIMENTS OOPS LAB

## CYCLE 1

1. Write a java program to print Hello
2. Write a java program to find sum of two numbers
3. Write a java program to swap two numbers using temporary variables
4. Write a java program to check whether a number is odd or even
5. Write a java program to find largest of two numbers

## CYCLE 2

6. Write a java program to check whether a number is prime or not
7. Write a java program to Reverse a String.
8. Write a java program to check string palindrome.
9. Write a Java Program to find the frequency of a given character in a
   string
10. Write a java Program to find Second Smallest Element of Array

## CYCLE 3

11. Write a java Program to find Transpose of a Matrix
12. Write a Java program to multiply two given matrices.
13. Write a Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having
    the following members: Name, Age, Phone number, Address, Salary. It
    also has a method named 'printSalary( )' which prints the salary of the
    Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Employee'
    class. The 'Officer' and 'Manager' classes have data members
    'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age,
    phone number, address and salary to an officer and a manager by making
    an object of both of these classes and print the same.
14. Where two java classes employee and engineer,engineer should
    inherit from employee class. Employee class to have two methods
    display() and calculate salary.Write a program to display the engineer
    salary and to display from employee class using a single object
    instantation
    [i.e. only one object creation is allowed ]. display() only prints the name
    of the class and doesn’t return any values. Eg- “name of class is
    employee”.calc_salary() in employee display “salary of employee is
    10000” and calc_salary() in engineer display “salary of employee is
    20000”
15. Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that
    contains an empty method named numberOfSides( ). Provide three
    classes named Rectangle, Triangle and Hexagon such that each one of
    the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes contains
    only the method numberOfSides( ) that shows the number of sides in the
    given geometrical structures
16. Write a java program to calculate the area of triangle, rectangle,
    square and circle using method overloading.

## CYCLE 4
17. Write a java program to demonstrate the use of garbage collection.
18. Write a java program that read form a file and write to another file
    handling and all related exception.
19. Write a java program with reader and writer.
20. Write a java program that read a line of integers and display each
    integers and sum of all integers.
21. Write a java program that show usage of try, catch and finally.
22. Write a java program to print odd and even using two threads in 1 to

## CYCLE 5
23. Write a java program that implements a multi-threaded program
    which uses 3 thread,1st
    thread generates a random integer in every one sec. If the value is even
    the second thread computes the square of the number and prints if the
    value of odd. The third thread will print the value of cube of the number.
24. Write a java program to show thread synchronization.
25. Write a java program that works as a simple calculator. Arrange
    button for digit and the +,-, \*, %, / operations properly. Add text field to
    display the result. Handle any possible exceptionlike divide by zero with
    swing.
26. Write a java program that stimulate traffic lights. The program let
    the user select one of the 3 traffic lights reed, green, yellow when the
    radio button is selected the light is turned on and only one light can be
    on at a time. No light is on when the program is started.
27. Write a java program to implement binary search.
